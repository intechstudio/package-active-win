# Active Window Package (WIP)

This repository contains the project code for the Active Window package for [Grid Editor](https://github.com/intechstudio/grid-editor).

The package allows the Editor to automatically change the active bank page based on the currently focused window. 
The package can be configured in the preferences window. 
The trigger application field should match the Active Window value for the page change to work.
